# SecureCRT_to_Ansible
This is a script to convert an xml file exported from SecureCRT to Yaml so it can be used for Ansible hosts.

# Follow these steps to get started!
1. Open SecureCRT
2. Click "Tools"
3. Click "Export Settings..."
4. Verify that ONLY "Sessions" is checkmarked. If not,
   make it so. ðŸ–– 
5. Export the file to the same directory as this script
6. Run script

# Issues/Help
This script has bugs and some cleanup will need to be done to the output in order to be used in Ansible.
You can use >> to save the output to a file. This script was quick and dirty and I only needed to run it once. Please don't judge!
